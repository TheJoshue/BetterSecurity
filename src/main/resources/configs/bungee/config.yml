#
# If you put an "@" in front of the text, it will broadcast the execution.
# Works for the following performers: [MESSAGE], [TITLE], [ACTION], [BOSSBAR], [SOUND]
# Examples: [MESSAGE] @&aHello World! | [TITLE] @&a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20
# | [ACTION] @&aHello World! | [BOSSBAR] @&aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5 | [SOUND] @BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1
#
# If you don't want to do anything, just put "[]" after "executors:"
# Example: executors: []
#
# You can use the following placeholders in all executors:
# - %player% | (Name of the player who attempted to execute the command)
# - %server% | (Server name)
# - %command% | (The command that was blocked)
# - %center% | (You can center text, only works with messages)

# ! NOTE: Please take a look at examples above, specifically the groups called "global" and "survival_cmdgroup1".
# We see that "global" has priority of 2 and "survival_cmdgroup1" has 1 - means that "survival_cmdgroup1" group is has greater priority than "global" group.
# We see that "global" is applied globally (for any server because it do not have whitelisted/blacklisted server) and "survival_cmdgroup1" is applied only to server "survival".
# We see that "global" has command "tp *" (blacklisted; that is group method) and "survival_cmdgroup1" has command "tp zS0bye" (whitelisted; that is group method) included.
# * What will this mean is that if we are on any server (even "survival") we will NOT be able to execute "/tp <anyarg1>" or even "/tp <anyarg1> <anyarg2> <anyarg3>" or
# however many arguments after base command; although we will be able to execute "/tp" command by itself (without any arguments) as it is not handled by anything specifically
# except that we will trigger some WHITELIST method from other groups... but if he didn't had that other group and only have this, we would be able to execute it, technically.
# * What we will ONLY BE ABLE to execute (using arguments) is "/tp zS0bye" and ONLY if we are on "survival" subserver because priority for "survival_cmdgroup1" is
# greater than "global" and this specific command ("/tp zS0bye") is whitelisted within it ("survival_cmdgroup1" group).
# * What we also won't be able to execute is "/tp zS0bye <anyarghere>" or any more arguments after this specific command mentioned, because we
# have "tp * *" blacklisted and it takes priority even if its group is set to have less priority than the group containing "tp zS0bye", this happens
# because we are having 3 args BEING EXECUTED WITHIN THE ACTUAL COMMAND, and we are first searching for that amount of args in the group, and because "survival_cmdgroup3"
# group has our matched amount of args, the group "survival_cmdgroup2" is not relevant because we will still do what "survival_cmdgroup3" allows us to do.
