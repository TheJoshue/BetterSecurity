# - [MINI_MESSAGE] mini format message                     | (Func. Send a chat message with the MiniMessage format)
#                                                          | (Tip. To use this format read this page: https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/index.html)
#                                                          | (Example: [MINI_MESSAGE] <green>Hello World!)
#
# - [TITLE] title;subtitle;fade-in;stay;fade-out           | (Func. Submit a title)
#                                                          | (Tip. If you enter "none" in the title or subtitle, it will not be displayed)
#                                                          | (Example: [TITLE] &a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20)
#
# - [ACTION] text                                          | (Func. Send a message in the action bar) | (Example: [ACTION] &aHello World!)
#
# - [BOSSBAR] title;color;style;progress;times             | (Func. Send a message in the boss bar. Compatible with versions 1.9+ only)
#                                                          | (Example: [BOSSBAR] &aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5)
#
# - [SOUND] sound;acute;volume                             | (Func. Send a sound) | (Example: [SOUND] BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1)

# - [PLAYER] command without '/'                           | (Func. Send a command as a player) | (Example: [PLAYER] spawn)
#
# - [CONSOLE] command without '/'                          | (Func. Send a command from the console) | (Example: [CONSOLE] give %player% DIAMOND 1)
#
# If you put an "@" in front of the text, it will broadcast the execution.
# Works for the following performers: [MESSAGE], [TITLE], [ACTION], [BOSSBAR], [SOUND]
# Examples: [MESSAGE] @&aHello World! | [TITLE] @&a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20
# | [ACTION] @&aHello World! | [BOSSBAR] @&aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5 | [SOUND] @BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1
#
# If you don't want to do anything, just put "[]" after "executors:"
# Example: executors: []
#
# You can use the following placeholders in all executors:
# - %player% | (Name of the player who attempted to execute the command)
# - %command% | (The command that was blocked)
# - %unknown_command% | (The spigot.yml unknown command message will be displayed)
# - %center% | (You can center text, only works with messages)

# ! NOTE: Please take a look at examples above, specifically the groups called "global" and "cmdgroup1".
# We see that "global" has priority of 2 and "cmdgroup1" has 1 - means that "cmdgroup1" group is has greater priority than "global" group.
# We see that "global" is applied globally (for any world because it do not have whitelisted/blacklisted world) and "cmdgroup1" is applied only to world "survival".
# We see that "global" has command "tp *" (blacklisted; that is group method) and "cmdgroup1" has command "tp zS0bye" (whitelisted; that is group method) included.
# * What will this mean is that if we are on any world (even "survival") we will NOT be able to execute "/tp <anyarg1>" or even "/tp <anyarg1> <anyarg2> <anyarg3>" or
# however many arguments after base command; although we will be able to execute "/tp" command by itself (without any arguments).
# * What we will ONLY BE ABLE to execute (using arguments) is "/tp zS0bye" and ONLY if we are on "survival" world because priority for "cmdgroup1" is
# greater than "global" and this specific commands is whitelisted in it (in "cmdgroup1" group).
# * What we also won't be able to execute is "/tp zS0bye <anyarghere>" or any more arguments after this specific command mentioned,
# because we have "tp * *" blacklisted and it takes priority because we are more likely that we are trying to run "tp * *" rather than "tp zS0bye <whatever>" as that
# second one is not declared anywhere and "tp * *" is.
